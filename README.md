# AWS Workshop Documentation

This repository contains documentation of what I learned in the AWS workshop on the AWS provided Control Design Workshop. This README provides an overview of the workshop and key takeaways.

## Workshop Overview

The workshop stages a situation where a company requires enhanced security controls over the 3 tier web app environment. To view the architecture that was implemented click here: [Link to Diagram](Architecture.png). it is required to implement a NIST 800-53rev5 compliant environemnt using the security services provided by AWS.


## Key Takeaways

This workshop gave me hands on experience on implementing AWS Config rules which is a service I have never used. I learned that AWS config has two ways of recording those two being continous and periodic. Additonally, you can manually configure an AWS Config Rule to re-evaluate, which is a useful tool to check if a change was correctly implemented. Also, you can apply config rules on all resources, certain resources, and on certain tags on resources (I assumed it was only on all resources).
To add on, I never had much experience with AWS Systems Manager
